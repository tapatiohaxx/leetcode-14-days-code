<h1> Binary Search </h1>

<b> Intro:  </b>  Binary searh is one of the major algorithms you will learn in an algorithms class. It is quick and simple to create. All that you have to know about the algorithm is that you have to divide the collection of items into two sets and find the set with the numbers closest to the number you are given.

<h3> My Approach </h3>
   When I began this problem, aI figured that using java wouls more than suffice. With Java, We start off with a class that looks like:

```

class Solution{
   public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
   } 
}
``` 
Seeing this, I managed to think of setting up myself first. I did this by initializing variables called ` first_key ` and ` last_key `  as well as ` pivot `
